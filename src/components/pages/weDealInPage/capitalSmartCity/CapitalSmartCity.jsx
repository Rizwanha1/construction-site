                            The concept of smart cities is new to Pakistan. Capital Smart City (CSC), Islamabad is proudly the first-ever smart city of Pakistan. It is located on the ideal location of M-2 Motorway, with easy access to the New Islamabad International Airport and the proposed ring road.

                            Very soon, it is expected that CSC will also be directly connected to the M-2 Motorway through a dedicated Interchange. This will further enhance the accessibility of this otherwise ideally located project.

                            As the name suggests, CSC is much more than a residential project. It aims to be a fully independent and sustainable smart city of Pakistan. The project is being developed by Future Development Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd. (FDH).

                            FDH is one of the largest real estate developers of Pakistan. Surbana Jurong, a Singapore-based consultancy firm, is the Master Planner of the Capital Smart City project. One of Pakistanâ€™s leading construction firms, Habib Rafiq (Pvt.) Ltd. are its developers.
